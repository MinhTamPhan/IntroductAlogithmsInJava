     Question 1
     Merging with smaller auxiliary array. Suppose that the subarray
     a[0] to a[n−1] is sorted and the subarray
     a[n] to a[2∗n−1]is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that  a[0]
     to a[2∗n−1]is sorted using an auxiliary array of length n
     (instead of 2n)
     coppy a[0] to a[n - 1] to auxiliary array after merge vs a[n] to a[2*n -1]
